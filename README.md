# [Project 1: Three-Dimensional points and lines](https://github.com/muhammadkhan2200/Three-Dimensional-Plotting-in-Python/tree/main)

Project Overview:
This project leverages Python's Matplotlib library to create a variety of three-dimensional plots, demonstrating the library's capabilities in visualizing complex data. The project includes multiple types of 3D plots, each serving to highlight different aspects of data visualization.
1. 3D Line and Scatter Plots: You use ax.plot3D and ax.scatter3D to plot a trigonometric spiral and random points near the line. This involves defining (x, y, z) triples and using these functions to visualize the data in 3D space.
2. 3D Contour Plots: You create 3D contour plots using ax.contour3D, which requires input data in the form of 2D regular grids. This is demonstrated with a 3D sinusoidal function.
3. Wireframes and Surface Plots: You generate wireframes and surface plots from gridded data. Wireframes use ax.plot_wireframe to project the data onto a 3D surface, while surface plots use an ax.plot_surface to fill the faces of the wireframe, often with a colormap to enhance visualization.

# [Project 2: Web Scraper with Python](https://github.com/muhammadkhan2200/Web-Scraper-with-Python/blob/main/README.md#web-scraper-with-python)
In this project, I created a web scraper using Python's urllib module. Here’s how it works:
1. Initialization: I start by initializing the Scraper class with a website URL, such as "https://news.google.com/".
2. Scraping Method: The scraping method sends an HTTP request to the website with urllib. request.urlopen(), retrieves the HTML content, and stores it in a variable.
3. HTML Parsing: I then use BeautifulSoup to parse the HTML and create a navigable structure.

# [Project 3:QR Codes with Python](https://github.com/muhammadkhan2200/QR-Codes-with-Python/tree/main)
Project Description: Generating QR Codes with Python This project demonstrates how to generate QR codes using Python. Here's a brief overview: Library Installation: The qrcode library is used, which can be installed via pip install qrcode. Basic Steps:

Import Library: Import the qrcode library.
1. Create QR Code: Use qrcode. make() to encode data into a QR code.
2. Save Image: Save the generated QR code as an image file using img. save().
3. Customization: Optionally, use the QRCode class to customize the QR code's version, error correction level, box size, and border.
4. import barcode from barcode import QRCode

# [Project 4: Spelling Correction with Python](https://github.com/muhammadkhan2200/Spelling-Correction-with-Python/tree/main)

I created a Python project for spelling correction, addressing both non-word and real-word errors to enhance text accuracy.
1. Using TextBlob
TextBlob is a simple library for natural language processing that includes a spelling correction feature. Here’s how you can use it:
2. Installation: pip install textblob
3. Usage:
