# [Project 1: Web Scraper with Python](https://github.com/muhammadkhan2200/Web-Scraper-with-Python/blob/main/README.md#web-scraper-with-python)
In this project, I created a web scraper using Python's urllib module. Here’s how it works:
1. Initialization: I start by initializing the Scraper class with a website URL, such as "https://news.google.com/".
2. Scraping Method: The scraping method sends an HTTP request to the website with urllib. request.urlopen(), retrieves the HTML content, and stores it in a variable.
3. HTML Parsing: I then use BeautifulSoup to parse the HTML and create a navigable structure.
